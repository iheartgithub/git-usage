GIT = a bit like r, github like rstudio 

Github, can see whats happening, nicer interface. Can do git without github, easier to use, fundamentally not different. Github = owned by micorsoft, git is free open source. Version control is about dealing w different files, gets into mess by having multiple files. Creates workflow. Easier way of organising files in time. Temporal version of file organisation. Critical for using code in massive teams, can also be useful if you're wanting to do massive changes to your code
